This experience solidified my desire to return to the tech industry and continue to specialize in the frontend domain.

Upon returning to Taiwan, I refreshed my technical foundation, focusing on Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS, and interactive animation (GSAP). I have independently completed multiple projects, continuously optimizing code structure, performance, and user experience. I aspire to be a Frontend Engineer who can collaborate seamlessly with designers and backend developers. 

 I look forward to joining a frontend team that values growth and practical implementation, where I can continuously deepen my technical expertise through projects and gradually take on the responsibility of independent feature module development.`}}}};export{e as default};
